# DM-my-DnD

This tool is designed to organize a DM's notes from campaigns that are played on computers. 

While playing with my friends, i found through playing as the DM that the longer the campaign, the more my notes.txt increased. 
I wrote notes for every town, character, and more! So i decided to make a something to easily organize the information.
Now all i have to do if i want to search up the Town "Julia", is i start filtering the name. And boom its there. The notes!
Along with the towns notes, i can see that i have created 4 characters that each have their own information in this town.

# Some features

- Character tab allows you roll create and edit characters by using notes/stats/spells. (pic example: http://puu.sh/kJAeF/3ea4afc687.png)
- The Towns tab allows you to create notes for your town, And view its residents as a bonus! Quickly see and edit a selected NPC from the town also.
- A general notes tab. (This is where i put my word effects and other general notes down!)
- Battle/encounter tab! Handles your turn, initiative, and health of creatures easily. 
When adding creatures to the battle tab, you can use a +5 in the initiative field to roll d20+5
Or you can roll health like 2d6 for a goblin! 
You can obviously add in your own specific value, just type it in and add!


# FAQ or answers maybe?

I use the built in random number generator from java. But a 3d6 isn't rolled as a nextInt(15)+3; I roll 3 dice for it. 
If you launch the program from a .bat file, You can see individual rolls from behind the scenes in the console.
This tool may not work for any platform other than windows, But i have attempted to add support in from my current knowledge.
